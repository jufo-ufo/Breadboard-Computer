1.3. Introduction

This is first official iteration of the homebrew von Neuman Machine
aka Computer aka CPU (*1). This Reference sheet/Specification/Documenation 
should document and discripe the our self build CPU. This CPU is designed
for build with DIP IC and basic electronic compends eg Resistor, Capacitors
and Transistors. The components shall be mounted onto Printed circet
Board or PCBs.

This development process is driven by Simon Walter and Alexander Wersching
(Jufo Gymansium Puchheim)

Some simple an general rules always should hold true:

 - Reads on High, Writes on edge
 - High is defined as 3.3V - 5V
 - Low is defined as 0V - 0.7V
 - floating 0.7 - 3.3V should be avoided
 - for basic logic NAND gates are preffered

(*1) It's no really an CPU, because it should feature RAM or Memory
    and Input and Output devices

3. Part specification

The following parts in the schematic now shall be described

3.1. BUS
    The Bus is an connecting point for every component in
    the CPU (besides Register File). The bus is an long
    circet Board with 64 parallel lines for data and address 
    transportation and for holding the CPU to gether.
    Every board is inserted perpendicular to the BUS for better
    use of space.

   /==========================/
     [Drawing of the bus PCB]
    
    
    The lines from 0-63 always should follow This
    structure:

[Ground] [Power] [Data] [Address] [Control] [unused] [Interupt set] [Intrupt ID] [ unused] [Clock] [Power] [Ground]
[   0  ] [  1  ] [2-18] [ 19-35 ] [ 36-44 ] [42-45 ] [     46     ] [   47-54  ] [ 55-60 ] [  61 ] [  62 ] [  63  ]

    Ground: 0V
    Power: 5V
    Data: General Data bus
    Address: The Address that gets feed to Main Memory
    Control: Operation ID transmission from CU to Module
    Interupt set: If an error/intrupt occurs this pin has to be set
    Interupt ID: 
    
    Control is connected to the CU for controlling every circet.
    Every circet has an unique ID that specifies the action/module.
    A module should test if the corresponding Data is put to
    the control lines. If the ID and data matches the Module is free
    to read or write data to the bus. Note that the rule "Writes on edge" 
    should always hold true. This is the reason the system clock is 
    exposed on the bus. Note that a module can have more then one Id 
    that is valid. For example the Memory module has one write and one 
    read ID. This system is put in places to insure maintainability 
    and flexibility.

3.2. ALU
    The ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit) is the calculating
    part of the Computer. It shall do the following jobs
    Adding, subtracting, bit shifting, xoring, anding, oring
    multiplying, differentiating (the big - small), comparing
    (>,<,=). As well as managing address and data flow

    For better developing, managing and trouble shotting the
    ALU should be build an an modular manner. Every operating
    eg. xor or add should be build as an separate PCB. This
    pcb should be inserted into the main ALU PCB.

    |                                              |
    +----------------------------------------------+

    Every Operation should be connected by the following
    standardized pin connector
